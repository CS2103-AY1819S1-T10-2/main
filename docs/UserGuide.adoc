== Introduction

HealthBook is for clinic receptionist who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing doctors and patients information and appointments*.

If you can type fast, HealthBook can help you maintain a clean and concise information management of your doctors and patients more efficiently compared traditional GUI apps.
