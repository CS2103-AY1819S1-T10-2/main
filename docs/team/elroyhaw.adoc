== PROJECT: HealthBook

---

== Overview

HealthBook is for clinic receptionist who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing doctors and patients information and appointments*.
It is *optimized for receptionist who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to add and delete appointments
** What it does: This allows the user to add new appointments and remove existing appointments that are done in the HealthBook.
** Justification: This feature enables the user to keep track of the upcoming and past appointments in the HealthBook, and updates the doctors' calendars at the same time.
** Highlights: This enhancement is the primary purpose of the HealthBook. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required integration with Google calendar commands.
** Credits: http://github.com/giamjuxian[giamjuxian] for the Google calendar integration

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added autocomplete commands on tab feature
** Added commands to view patients/doctors
** Added commands to delete patients/doctors
