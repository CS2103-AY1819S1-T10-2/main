== PROJECT: AddressBook - Level 4

---

== Overview

HealthBook is for clinic receptionist who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing doctors and patients information and appointments*.
It is *optimized for receptionist who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add/delete a prescription of an appointment*
** What it does: allows the user (receptionist) to add/delete a prescription to add more relevant details to the appointment.
** Justification: This allows the receptionist to keep a record of the prescription related to the appointment to have more information about the visit and patient's conditions.
It will also be useful in the event where patients forgets/is unsure about the prescription and this can be easily accessed.
** Highlights: This enhancement value adds to the HealthBook and is one of the major features of a medical appointment.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required creating of new models and interaction with all components of the code.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added remark command that adds an unconstrained information snippet to each contact for each person's place card for a quick view of the person's details.
** Made parameters non-case sensitive for all commands i.e `view-patient n/john doe` will view the patient `John Doe`
