== PROJECT: HealthBook

---

== Overview

HealthBook is for clinic receptionist who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing doctors and patients information and
appointments*. It is *optimized for receptionist who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the command to register both doctors and patients
** What it does: This allows the user to register new doctors and patients.
** Justification: This feature enables the user to add new doctors and patients into the HealthBook so that further
commands can be called on them.
** Highlights: This enhancement is required for all other commands of the HealthBook to work. It required an in-depth considerations
of the data structure to store the information of patients and doctors. The implementation required a good understanding of
what was already implemented in the previous versions and what is required for further implementations of subsequent commands
and usage.

* *Major enhancement*: Integrated Google Calendar into HealthBook
** What it does: This allows information on appointments to be presented to doctors in their Google calendar when appointments
are added or deleted. They will be able to review the patient they are seeing as well as time of the appointment easily.
** Justification: This feature allows doctors to receive information about their upcoming appointments in a decentralized
 manner. Receptionists can use this integration to pass information to doctors that may not be in the clinic at that point in time.
** Highlights: This enhancement is required for good understand of both integration of Google's API and other commands of
the HealthBook. It required a extensive understanding of integration in Java and the Google's API that is available to use.
In addition, this implementation required a good analysis of how the Google Calendar can compliment the features in the HealthBook.
** ** Credits: Google's API

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added autocomplete commands on tab feature
** Added commands to view patients/doctors
** Added commands to delete patients/doctors
** Updated UI and events after every command call
